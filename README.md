🚀 Project Overview

The Student Performance Predictor is an end-to-end machine learning project that aims to predict a student's final exam score based on various input features such as study time, past performance, parental background, and more.

This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a machine learning solution — from data ingestion and exploratory analysis to model training, evaluation, and deployment using a Flask web application.

The primary goal is to showcase how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems in education and help identify students who may need academic support early on.

🔍 Key Objectives:
 - Understand and clean real-world student performance data

 - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering

 - Build and evaluate multiple regression models

 - Develop an ML pipeline for consistent preprocessing and training

 - Deploy the final model into a user-friendly Flask web app
